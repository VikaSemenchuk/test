                                But, as with any kind of
                                technology, there is a surplus of options on the market, and not all of them are worth buying.

                    <p class="blog-article-bottom-paragraph">The very first step in this checklist is to decide if you want
                        a pair of gaming headphones or a pair of gaming headsets.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-article-bottom-paragraph">So what is the difference between gaming headphones and gaming
                        headsets?

                    <p class="blog-article-bottom-paragraph">Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic <br />
                        Gaming headphones are regular headphones that are used traditionally for music enjoyment. However,
                        they possess
                        qualities that are awesome for gaming needs too. Audiophilic characteristics such as great
                        micro-detail retrieval,
                        accurate sound stage and immersive sound experience make them feasible to double up as a pair of
                        gaming headphones.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-article-bottom-paragraph">However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor
                        do they have any mic attachment slots. You will need to
                        get an external mic like the Blue Yeti X for communication support.</p>
                    <p class="blog-article-bottom-paragraph">A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is
                        Ninja, famous for streaming PUBG and Fortnight. He uses the
                        Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro with Audio Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone while streaming his
                        games.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-article-bottom-paragraph">There are several benefits and drawbacks to using a gaming
                        headphones setup for gaming.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-article-bottom-paragraph">Benefits of Gaming Headphones <br />
                        Higher upsides for audio and mic quality <br />
                        As you have a wider product selection for both the headphones and mic itself, you are able to
                        assemble your gaming setup with the latest mic and headphones. There is potential for better overall audio and microphone quality.</p>
